**Usecase:**

IVEY BOT is a very fast CLI telegram scraper behind your normal telegram user account with forwarding functions to automate your onchain trading.
IVEY is like an extension for trading bots with auto-buy functions (Trojan, Bonkbot etc.)
With this bot, you can monitor as many Telegram channels and groups in real-time as you want. Whenever the bot detects a token address in a post, it automatically extracts it and can forward it wherever you like. Conditions can also be defined through the keyword function to specify when the bot should forward and when it should not.
For example, you can send it to a buybot with an auto-buy function or to another Telegram group. The extraction and forwarding process takes just 0.5 seconds. The bot can extract token addresses from
any link—whether it's a Solscan, Dexscreener, Photon link, or whatever—and it only sends the extracted address to your specified destination.
You can send scraped token addresses to 2 different buy bots at the same time.

**How is IVEY Bot different from regular Telegram bots?**

- Most regular Telegram bots aren't even allowed to join call channels or groups.

- Regular Telegram bots can't interact with other bots, like trading bots. So, you wouldn't be able to forward a token address to a trading bot, for example.

- You can monitor individual users within a Telegram group, and if they post a token address, it will be forwarded directly to a buy bot.

- You can define keywords that must appear or must not appear in the message for the token address to be forwarded to a buy bot.<br><br>

The bot enables many automations and is hidden behind your normal Telegram user account. Even while the bot is running, you can continue to use your Telegram account as usual.
The bot also has a built-in database that logs every forwarded address. Before forwarding, it checks whether the address has already been sent before to avoid duplicates. 
The bot doesn’t need a private key because it doesn’t actually execute any buys—it just forwards the address, like to Trojan or BullX.

You can even specify certain users within a Telegram group, so the bot only monitors messages from those specific users. If you know there are certain users who make good calls, 
you can target their posts specifically. 

The bot also has a keyword function. This allows defining keywords that must be present in the same message as the token address for it to be forwarded to your buy bot. The function also allows defining keywords that must not be present in the message.

The bot operates under the radar, disguised as your regular Telegram account since it works through your Telegram User API. So, no one will know it's actually a bot.

The bot works for all major chains.
