## **IVEY BOT: Advanced Telegram Scraper for Automated On-Chain Trading**

**IVEY BOT** is a lightning-fast CLI Telegram scraper that operates seamlessly behind your regular Telegram user account. With powerful forwarding functionalities, it automates your on-chain trading processes.

### 🚀 **Key Features**

- **Real-Time Monitoring:**  
  Monitor unlimited Telegram channels and groups simultaneously. IVEY BOT detects token addresses in posts, extracts them instantly, and forwards them to your desired destinations.

- **Conditional Forwarding:**  
  Utilize the keyword function to set specific conditions for forwarding. Define when the bot should or shouldn't forward a token address based on the presence or absence of certain keywords.

- **Rapid Processing:**  
  The extraction and forwarding process occurs in just half a second, ensuring you stay ahead in the fast-paced trading environment.

- **Versatile Link Support:**  
  Extract token addresses from any type of link, including Solscan, Dexscreener, Photon, and more. The bot forwards only the extracted address to your specified destination.

- **Multi-Bot Support:**  
  Forward scraped token addresses to two different buy bots simultaneously, enhancing your trading strategy's effectiveness.

### 🔍 **How IVEY BOT Differs from Regular Telegram Bots**

- **Enhanced Access:**  
  Unlike regular Telegram bots, IVEY BOT can join both channels and groups, providing comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

- **Bot Interaction:**  
  IVEY BOT can interact with other bots, such as trading bots, allowing seamless forwarding of token addresses to execute trades.

- **User-Specific Monitoring:**  
  Monitor individual users within a Telegram group. If selected users post a token address, it gets forwarded directly to your buy bot.

- **Advanced Keyword Filtering:**  
  Define specific keywords that must appear or must not appear in messages for token addresses to be forwarded, ensuring precise and relevant forwarding.

### 🛠️ **Additional Advantages**

- **Hidden Operation:**  
  IVEY BOT operates discreetly behind your regular Telegram account via the Telegram User API. You can continue using your Telegram account normally while the bot runs in the background.

- **Duplicate Prevention:**  
  Featuring a built-in database, IVEY BOT logs every forwarded address and checks for duplicates before forwarding, ensuring efficient and organized data management.

- **No Private Key Required:**  
  IVEY BOT does not require a private key since it doesn't execute any buy orders directly. It simply forwards token addresses to other bots like NOVA; Trojan or BullX.

- **Selective User Monitoring:**  
  Specify certain users within a Telegram group to monitor only their messages. Target posts from users known for making accurate calls to optimize your trading strategy.

- **Keyword Functionality:**  
  Define mandatory and prohibited keywords within messages to control the forwarding of token addresses to your buy bot, enhancing the bot's precision and effectiveness.

- **Cross-Chain Compatibility:**  
  IVEY BOT supports all major blockchain networks, ensuring broad applicability across different trading ecosystems.

### 🌟 **Why Choose IVEY BOT?**

IVEY BOT empowers you with advanced automation tools to enhance your on-chain trading activities. Its seamless integration with your Telegram account, combined with its powerful features, ensures that you can monitor and act on trading opportunities swiftly and efficiently.
